# BoomSim

A simplified C++ game based on the iconic battleship board game.
During my freshman year of high school, I learned how to code. To celebrate all the things I have learned throughout the year,
I created my own text game based on battleships. It is a pretty long game, but it does work. There are some little kinks here
and there, but it is a solid experience. The only way the game differs from the actual board game is that it only has one
length for every ship. The board game has different lengths for every ship, but this game only has one, one by one, index for 
each ship. This made me excited for programming for years to come and I hope to impact the world the same way that my game 
impacted my friends and family by making them happy. It was one of my very first projects, so please enjoy!
